# AWS Recipes in Action
> Examples, recipes and documentation about Amazon Web Services, mostly based in the book *Amazon Web Services in Action* (Manning, 2016), but also complemented with documentation from http://docs.aws.amazon.com and other sources where the details found in the book fell short. 

The recipes and articles have been loosely classified into sections:
+ [**01: Getting Started**](01-getting-started/) &mdash; Getting started hints, such as creating key pairs to connect to EC2 instances, etc.
+ [**02: The Command Line Interface (CLI)**](02-cli/) &mdash; Usage examples of AWS CLI from shell scripts
+ [**03: The API**](03-api/) &mdash; Using *AWS SDK* to interact with Amazon Web Services
+ [**04: IaC**](04-iac/) &mdash; Using CloudFormation templates *(in YAML!)* to automate the creation of virtual infrastructure and services


## Documentation

+ [**IAM**](docs/01-iam/main.md) &mdash; The Identity and Access Management (IAM) Service
+ [**Networking**](docs/02-networking/main.md) &mdash; Networking on AWS
