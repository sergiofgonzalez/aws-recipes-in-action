# AWS Recipes in Action
> Examples, recipes and documentation about Amazon Web Services, mostly based in the book *Amazon Web Services in Action* (Manning, 2016), but also complemented with documentation from http://docs.aws.amazon.com and other sources where the details found in the book fell short. 

The recipes and articles have been loosely classified into sections:
+ **01-getting-started** &mdash; Getting started hints, such as creating key pairs to connect to EC2 instances, etc.
+ **02-cli** &mdash; Usage example of AWS CLI to perform tasks with shell scripts
+ **02-api** &mdash; Examples about how to use the API to interact with Amazon Web Services
+ **03-iac** &mdash; CloudFormation templates *(in YAML!)* to automate the creation of virtual infrastructure and services
