### [0 &mdash; Creating the Key Pair](00-creating-key-pair/)
Illustrates how to create a key pair using `ssh-keygen` and how to import the key pair in your AWS account.

## Documentation

To access a virtual server in AWS you need a key pair consisting of a private key and public key. Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information.

To log into your instance, you must create a key pair, specify the name of the key pair when you launch the instance, and provide the private key when you connect to the instance.

### Creating the Key-Pair
You can use Amazon EC2 to create your key pair, but you can also create the key-pair with a third party tool as long as the generated key is in one of the accepted formats:
+ OpenSSH public key format (e.g. generated by `ssh-keygen`)
+ Base64 encoded DER format
+ SSH public key file format

Supported lengths are 1024, 2048 and 4096 bits.

To create a 4096 bit, RSA, key pair using `ssh-keygen` type:
```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "aws-in-action-key-pair"
$ mv aws-in-action-key-pair aws-in-action-key-pair.pem
```

### Importing the Key-Pair
Open the *Amazon EC2 console*, navigate to *Network and Security* section and choose *Key Pairs*.

### Connecting to a Virtual Server configured with that Key Pairs
You can connect to an EC2 virtual server (assuming its IPv4 address is 52.14.87.11) configured with the public key of the recently generated key pair by typing:
```bash
$ ssh -i aws-in-action-key-pair.pem ubuntu@52.14.87.11
```
